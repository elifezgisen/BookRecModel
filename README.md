## Book Recommendation System Model

Book recommendation system that includes a model consisting of a combination of three different layers: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Factorization Machines (FM), and Field Sensitive Interaction Neural Network (FINT).

With this Deep Learning Model, it is aimed to develop a recommendation system based on the scores that users create by evaluating the books according to the data set. 

The code includes stages such as label coding, data preprocessing, model creation, and model training.
